For context, see [past roadmap-focused RFCs](https://github.com/wagtail/rfcs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+label%3Aroadmap) and the [Wagtail release schedule](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Release-schedule).

## Version number for the next release

## Roadmap for the previous release

Here is the status of roadmap items for the latest release, vX.Y-1 (Month YYYY):

Summary: short overview of the proposed work. One paragraph, tweet-sized. Optionally, add a list of 2-5 items detailing what will be the result of this work. It’s ok if some of it is tentative.

If relevant – a list of 1-3 links to related issues, pull requests, RFCs, discussions, blog posts, or documentation.

## Roadmap for the next+1 release

Proposed roadmap items for vX.Y+1 (Month YYYY):

## Roadmap for "Future" releases

<!-- Add items with the same template as above -->

## Proposed roadmap items to close

<!-- Occasionally useful to propose removal of items that don’t feel achievable or no longer desirable. -->

None

## Items that didn't make the cut

<!-- Use this to highlight interesting ideas that suffer from opportunity cost or are just too out there. -->

Here are possible roadmap items that were discussed but not included in the roadmap this time, provided for feedback and for future reference.
